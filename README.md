This project/web app is about Movie Recommendation System.
In this, I use 5000 movie dataset from Kaggle and clean this in a python notebook. Here I use streamlit library to create a web app.
Here I use the cosine_similarity algorithm to find similar movies depending on Director, cast, production companies, etc.
